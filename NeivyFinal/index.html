    <h1>A Great Suprise</h1>
    <h2>By Neivy Muniz</h2>
    <p>This animation was create din After Effects. My goal was to depict three emotions: boredom, sadness and end it with happiness. The protagonist is bored at the beginning, then he hears his favorite song which makes him sad since no one is around to dance with him... but a surprise is around the corner...  </p>
